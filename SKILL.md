  Incrementally upgrade Rails `config.load_defaults` by walking through each
  new_framework_defaults config one at a time. Use this skill whenever the user
  mentions load_defaults upgrade, new_framework_defaults, framework defaults,
  or wants to bring their Rails app's default configuration up to match their
  Rails version. Also trigger when the user mentions a gap between their Rails
  version and their load_defaults version (e.g., "app is on Rails 7.2 but
  load_defaults is 6.1"). This skill handles the iterative uncomment-test-commit
  workflow and the final consolidation into config/application.rb.

# Rails load_defaults Upgrade Skill

This skill guides the incremental upgrade of `config.load_defaults` in a Rails
application. The process walks through each config introduced in a new Rails
version, one at a time, so the user can test each change in isolation.

## Overview

When a Rails app has a `load_defaults` version lower than its Rails version,
there are framework default configs that need to be adopted. This skill:

1. Detects the current `load_defaults` version
2. Determines the next target version
3. Generates the `new_framework_defaults_X_Y.rb` initializer with all configs commented
4. Walks through each config one by one, analyzing the codebase to recommend values
5. Waits for the user to test/commit each change before moving to the next
6. Consolidates into `config/application.rb` when all configs are done

## Step 1: Detect Current State

Read `config/application.rb` and look for:
```ruby
config.load_defaults X.Y
```

Also check if a `config/initializers/new_framework_defaults_*.rb` file already
exists (the user may be mid-upgrade).

Report to the user:
- Current `load_defaults` version
- Current Rails version (from Gemfile.lock)
- Which version transitions are needed (e.g., 6.1 → 7.0 → 7.1 → 7.2)

## Step 2: Load Version Config Reference

Read the appropriate config reference file for the target version:

- **7.0**: `configs/7_0.yml`
- **7.1**: `configs/7_1.yml`
- **7.2**: `configs/7_2.yml`

Each config file contains entries organized into tiers with lookup patterns
and decision trees for each config.

## Step 3: Create the Initializer File

If no `new_framework_defaults_X_Y.rb` exists yet, copy the template from
the `templates/` directory into the app's `config/initializers/`:

- **7.0**: Copy `templates/new_framework_defaults_7_0.rb` → `config/initializers/new_framework_defaults_7_0.rb`
- **7.1**: Copy `templates/new_framework_defaults_7_1.rb` → `config/initializers/new_framework_defaults_7_1.rb`
- **7.2**: Copy `templates/new_framework_defaults_7_2.rb` → `config/initializers/new_framework_defaults_7_2.rb`

These templates contain the exact canonical Rails initializer with all configs
commented out, matching what `rails app:update` would generate. Always use
the template rather than generating from scratch — this ensures the comments,
formatting, and config ordering match the Rails source.

## Step 4: Iterative Config Walkthrough

Process configs in order from safest (Tier 1) to those needing analysis (Tier 2).

For each config:

### 4a. Analyze the Codebase

Run the lookup patterns defined in the config reference:
- Use `grep -r` or `find` to search for the patterns listed
- Check the specific files/directories indicated
- Apply the decision tree to determine the recommended value

### 4b. Present Recommendation

Tell the user:
- What the config does (old behavior → new behavior)
- What you found in their codebase
- Your recommended value and why
- Risk level (low/medium/high)

### 4c. Apply the Change

Once the user agrees:
- Uncomment the config line in the initializer file
- Set the value (either the new default or the override value)

### 4d. Wait for User

Stop and wait. The user will:
- Commit and push the change
- Run CI or manually test
- Come back to confirm success or report failure

If the change broke something:
- Re-comment the config line or set it to the old value
- Note it as needing investigation
- Move to the next config

### 4e. Handle application_rb_only Configs

Some configs are marked `application_rb_only` in the version reference YAML.
These cannot go in the initializer file and must be tested directly in
`config/application.rb`.

During the iterative walkthrough, when you reach these configs:
- Add them explicitly in `config/application.rb` (after the existing
  `load_defaults` line) so they can be tested in isolation
- Mark them with a comment so they're easy to find during consolidation:

```ruby
config.load_defaults 6.1

# TESTING load_defaults 7.0 — remove during consolidation if using new default
config.active_support.cache_format_version = 7.0
```

- Wait for the user to test/commit as with any other config

### 4f. Track Progress

Keep track of which configs have been processed by reading the initializer
file. Commented lines = pending. Uncommented lines = done.

For `application_rb_only` configs, track them by looking for the
`# TESTING load_defaults` comments in `config/application.rb`.

## Step 5: Consolidation

When all configs in the initializer have been uncommented and tested:

1. Delete the `config/initializers/new_framework_defaults_X_Y.rb` file
2. Update `config.load_defaults` in `config/application.rb` to the new version
3. **CRITICAL**: For any configs where you kept the OLD behavior/value (i.e., did
   not adopt the new default), you MUST add explicit overrides in
   `config/application.rb` after the `load_defaults` line. If you skip this,
   setting `load_defaults` to the new version will silently switch those configs
   to their new default values — undoing your deliberate decision to keep the
   old behavior.

   Each config entry in the version reference YAML includes an `old_default`
   field. Use that value for the override.

```ruby
config.load_defaults 7.0

# Override: kept old behavior because CSS targets input[type=submit] from button_to
config.action_view.button_to_generates_button_tag = false

# Override: kept old behavior because app uses namespaced UUIDs as stored identifiers
config.active_support.use_rfc4122_namespaced_uuids = false
```

4. **Remove `application_rb_only` configs that use the NEW default.** During
   testing (Step 4e), these were added explicitly in `config/application.rb`
   with `# TESTING load_defaults` comments. Now that `load_defaults` is set
   to the new version, the new defaults are already implied — keeping them
   is redundant. Remove them.

   Only keep `application_rb_only` configs if you chose the OLD value:

```ruby
config.load_defaults 7.0

# load_defaults 7.0 already sets cache_format_version = 7.0,
# so do NOT explicitly set it here. Just remove the testing line.

# Override: kept old behavior because [reason]
config.active_support.disable_to_s_conversion = false
```

5. Remind the user to commit and do a final round of testing.

## Step 6: Next Version

If more version transitions are needed, start again at Step 2 with the next
version.

## Important Notes

- Never rush through configs. Each one gets its own commit and test cycle.
- Some configs have notes saying they must go in `config/application.rb` (not
  the initializer). Flag these clearly and handle them during consolidation.
- When the decision tree says "if unsure, keep the old default" — do that.
  It's always safer to be conservative.
- The user's testing (CI, manual QA) is the ultimate arbiter. The codebase
  analysis is guidance, not gospel.
